# Fractal-generator
Simple fractal generator using Julia fractal set given by the formula: Z(k+1) = Z(k)^2 + Zc.
The program is developed in Java using Window application plugin for Eclipse.
It is quite simple application in which the real and imaginary part of Zc can be changed.
There are about 40 000 possible combinations and fractals to be produced.|
The application is under development and newer and more advanced versions are to be expected.
